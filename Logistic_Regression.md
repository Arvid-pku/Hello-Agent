# Tutorial for Logistic Regression
## Introduction
Logistic Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for binary classification. This tutorial will guide you through the implementation of a simple logistic regression model from scratch, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn.

## Implementation Steps
1. Data Preparation: Generate or load a dataset suitable for logistic regression.
2. Model Definition: Define the hypothesis (sigmoid function) and cost function.
3. Training: Implement gradient descent to minimize the cost function and learn the model parameters.
4. Prediction: Use the learned model to make predictions on new data.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Code Explanation
In `Logistic_Regression.py`, you will find the Python code implementing these steps. The comments in the code provide detailed explanations of each part.
