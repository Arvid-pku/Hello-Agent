# Tutorial for Support Vector Machine (SVM)
## Introduction
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. This tutorial will guide you through the implementation of a simple SVM model from scratch, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn.

## Implementation Steps
1. Data Preparation: Generate or load a dataset suitable for SVM.
2. Model Definition: Define the margin and support vectors.
3. Training: Find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.
4. Prediction: Use the learned hyperplane to classify new data points.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Code Explanation
In `algorithm_6.py`, you will find the Python code implementing these steps. The comments in the code provide detailed explanations of each part.
