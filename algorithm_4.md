# Tutorial for Random Forest
## Introduction
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This tutorial will guide you through the implementation of a simple random forest model from scratch, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn.

## Implementation Steps
1. Data Preparation: Generate or load a dataset suitable for random forest.
2. Model Definition: Define how to construct individual decision trees and how they form the forest.
3. Training: Construct multiple decision trees using bootstrapped samples and different subsets of features.
4. Prediction: Aggregate the predictions from all trees to make the final prediction.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Code Explanation
In `algorithm_4.py`, you will find the Python code implementing these steps. The comments in the code provide detailed explanations of each part.
