# Tutorial for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
## Introduction
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet powerful, non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In this tutorial, we'll implement a KNN classifier from scratch, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn.

## Implementation Steps
1. Data Preparation: Generate or load a dataset suitable for KNN.
2. Model Definition: Define the distance metric and the number of neighbors (k).
3. Training: Since KNN is a lazy learner, there's no explicit training phase. However, we need to store the training data.
4. Prediction: For each test instance, find the k nearest neighbors in the training set and predict the class label based on the majority vote.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Code Explanation
In `algorithm_5.py`, you will find the Python code implementing these steps. The comments in the code provide detailed explanations of each part.
