# Tutorial for Decision Tree
## Introduction
Decision Tree is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. This tutorial will guide you through the implementation of a simple decision tree model from scratch, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn.

## Implementation Steps
1. Data Preparation: Generate or load a dataset suitable for decision tree.
2. Model Definition: Define the structure of the decision tree and splitting criteria.
3. Training: Recursively split the data based on the best feature and threshold to build the tree.
4. Prediction: Use the constructed tree to make predictions on new data.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Code Explanation
In `Decision_Tree.py`, you will find the Python code implementing these steps. The comments in the code provide detailed explanations of each part.
